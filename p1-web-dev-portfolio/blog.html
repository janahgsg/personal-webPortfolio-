            <h4>Losing Interest in Coding</h4>
            <p>I remember when I was in 11th grade, I used to really enjoy coding—especially when we were learning HTML and CSS. It felt exciting at first, like I was building something real. But eventually, the lessons became more difficult, and honestly, the teaching didn't help either. There was a lack of clear explanation, and I slowly lost the motivation I had. That's when I started relying on tools to help me finish tasks and activities at school. As long as I understood the code and what it did, I told myself it was okay—it's not the end of the world. "As long as I understand what it says, everything's going to be fine," I thought. It worked for a while. Then days turned into weeks, and weeks into months. But the lessons kept getting harder, and deep inside, I knew I was not really learning.</p>
            
            <p>Eventually, I'd sit in front of the screen during hands-on activities, completely stuck. My memory used to be sharp, but coding pushed me to my limits. Every week brought new lessons, and the stress piled up. I couldn't break the habit of depending on quick answers. I didn't feel like myself anymore. Coding used to excite me—but now, it made me anxious.</p>

            <h4>Waking Up Too Late</h4>
            <p>There were moments, though, when I realized I needed to change. If I wanted better grades and to become a high honor student, I had to step up—especially in my major subject, computer programming. It felt like I was playing a simulation game or managing a business tycoon—so many things happening at once! But somehow, I managed to understand how "most" of everything worked. Sadly, by the time I started getting the hang of things, we had already moved on to Java. That's when I realized how much I had messed up during the earlier CSS and JavaScript lessons. But even then, I reminded myself, "It's not too late."</p>
            
            <p>It's a bit embarrassing to admit all this—to tell a story where I basically ignored my responsibilities. But looking back, it taught me some serious lessons. Life throws us challenges and sometimes we take the wrong road. But that doesn't mean we're stuck there forever. I started to believe that failure isn't the end—it's just a hard part of a bigger lesson. And even if I didn't start strong, I could still finish better.</p>

          <div class="blog-body">
            <h4>Joining TaHa Foundation</h4>
            <p>That mindset helped me take a new step forward. Few months later, I was forced by my peers to join Taha Foundation Scholarship to front-end web developer and so I did apply for fun not taking it seriously—and to my surprise I was accepted into TaHa Foundation's program at Uplift Code Camp! This was a new chapter for me. I was nervous, but also excited. I felt like maybe this was the restart I needed. My first time being part of the FDP Taha community I began to ask questions—something I didn't usually do. I even made new acquaintances, which is rare for me, since I usually keep to myself. It really felt like I was finally growing.</p>
            
            <p>But then, something happened that shook me. I made a mistake during one of the coding activities, and it hit me hard. My confidence dropped again, just when I thought I was starting fresh. I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. I took it so personally, and all the self-doubt came rushing back. I started to feel like I was stuck in the same cycle again. Like maybe I wasn't meant for this after all. I thought, "This isn't a new beginning... it's just everything repeating again."</p>

            <h4>Bootcamp Changed My Mindset</h4>
            <p>But something changed my perspective. Even after my mistake, people at Uplift Code Camp still greeted me with smiles. They acted like nothing happened. That small gesture gave me comfort. The instructors and the whole community continued to support me throughout the day, the week, and the course. Their kindness reminded me of something important: it's not about being perfect, it's about showing up, moving forward, and learning every step of the way. Having a workshop led by Ma'am Jess about our mental health somehow makes me feel relaxed—being reminded that it's okay to be in this vulnerable position as long as you know how to bounce back to the ground.</p>
            
            <p>I'm really grateful to the TaHa Foundation for giving me this opportunity—especially knowing that I was one of only 60+ people selected. I may still be new to coding, and I get anxious a lot, but I have the dedication to keep going. And thanks to Uplift Code Camp, I now see coding as an experiment—something to explore and play with. If the syntax breaks, fix it. If it doesn't make sense, dig deeper until it does. It's not always easy. In fact, I often find myself struggling but hey, in every struggle—I get to understand each parts. That's why I have to keep trying, keep experimenting, and grow into the coder I want to become.</p>
